# Fun Graph

Let your graph tell you something!

To generate such a graph, just run the following command:

```bash
$ python3 fun.py
```

## Dependencies

- matplotlib
- numpy

## TODOs

- Handle all alphabetical characters
- Random point generation should be part of the generator
- Documentation
- Smoother curve generation than plain staight lines
- Any new idea :-)
